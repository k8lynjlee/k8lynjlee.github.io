			When I learned that proposed budget cuts totaling $24 million were under consideration by my school board and superintendent – and that one proposed cut was to completely eliminate the district’s 5th grade orchestra and band – I and several other students and parents attended school board meetings to express our concerns and talk about how important music education was to us personally and as members of the school band. I initiated and organized students to submit a petition and letters to the legislators in Olympia. Some school board members were unaware that the proposed cuts would eliminate 6.3 music teachers’ jobs, and didn’t have a clear picture of the impact of the cuts on the middle school and high school programming. I thought of a unique idea to publicly make a stand for music. I led and organized students to come together to stage an instrumental flash mob at a local bowling alley. It was designed to raise awareness about the proposed budget cuts to the music education program and also have fun during spring break. The <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2vPsQPq5ao">YouTube video</a> went viral, and many students talked to community members about their cause. Due to the overwhelming demand by our group and others, our voice was heard, the music program was spared, and music educator’s jobs were saved. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I entered our music advocacy campaign in DoSomething.org and VH1's Battle for the Bands campaign, where students across the U.S. took measures to preserve school music programs threatened by budget troubles. The Mountain View High School band won the Grand Prize and earned a $5,000 grant from DoSomething.org and VH1. 
</p><p>
			I learned that it is important to speak up and take a stand for what you believe in, and that students can come together and be heard. I was honored to receive the Mountain View Blue Thunder Award for outstanding community service in May 2011.
